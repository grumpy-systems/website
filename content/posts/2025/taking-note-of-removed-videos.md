title: "Taking Note Of Removed Videos From US Government Channels"
date: 2025-02-17
tags: ["random"]
type: post
---

After it was announced that data from Government sites such as the CDC and FDA
were being removed, I did what any good Data Hoarder does and started hoarding
more.  I have a fairly small instance of
[TubeArchivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist) to keep a list
of niche channels downloaded, but I turned it to a number of Government channels
to try and save as much content as I could in fear that it would be removed.

Those fears were justified as over this past weekend, the [CFPB's YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cfpbvideo) was emptied, and I'm seeing a
number of videos being removed from other channels I did download.

## Methodology and Disclaimers

Starting on February 1st, I started a bulk download of these YouTube channels:

* CDC
* FDA
* HHS
* FEMA
* Census

And starting days later, I added these:

* Kennedy Center
* Department of State
* National Archives

I start my bulk downloads with a list of video ID's, and I then break them into
chunks of around 100.  I then feed the download queue whenever it's empty to
keep things continually downloading.  There's no set order, the chunks are
randomized in each channel, and there's only one download thread active at a
time to prevent rate limits.

I re-ran the scripts to get what should be the same list, but videos that were
removed will be absent.  Finding video IDs in the old list that aren't in the
new list gives us a manifest of what was removed.  Many of these I have copies
and metadata for, so the title is shared.  Some I have a video file, but I lack
metadata due to rate limits and other bugs.

Keep in mind, there's no way to know why a video was removed.  It could be the
result of an executive order barring the discussion of certain terms, or it
could be normal culling due to a number of innocent factors.  I included all my
channels, and some show what I believe to be normal culling for comparison.

## Where Can I Find These Videos?

I'm uploading my videos to my
[Archive.Org](https://archive.org/details/@grumpy_systems) account.  The uploads
are paced quite slow mostly to not upset anyone.  If a video hasn't been
uploaded, it will make it there _eventually_ (I only do a hundred or so a day,
and these are mixed in with active videos as well). If you need a copy, let me
know and I can bump it to the top of my list.

Some videos are missing entirely, as they were removed before I could download
them.  The IDs are shared, but there will be no links.
