As I write this, it's January 17, and the fate of TikTok in the United States is
very much uncertain.  I generally avoid politics, but this case is an
interesting case of several political feelings I have intersecting with
technology, so I'm here writing about it.

## Clearing The Air

I am a TikTok user, but I have no financial incentive to do so.  Though invited,
I never opted into payments directly to creators or selling in their
marketplace.  I also was not a large creator there (or anywhere), but I did have
a few thousand followers and a few million views on videos.

All these thoughts are my own, and I obviously am not involved in any of the
internal discussion so there will be some speculation.  I'll try to cite
concrete sources for some arguments when needed.

## Why I Liked TikTok

First, I want to highlight some of the positives of TikTok and why I chose to
use the platform, despite my concerns with privacy.

TikTok had a feeling of being a small, tight-knit platform even for its size.
You could easily find creators with few followers that overlap with your niche
interests or creators showcasing incredible talent alongside large, massively
popular accounts.  The algorithm was very good at keeping things relevant, so
content was usually well received.  Other platforms are good at this too, but
the short-form video content lends itself to great memes and quick blurbs of
insight.

Speaking from outside my personal experience, you could see people enacting
fantastic change.  One account was a creator who traveled to homes and mowed
their overgrown yards for free.  Not only is it satisfying to watch the waist
high grass get trimmed, but often he showcased stories of people genuinely on
hard times.  In a recent video, he raised over $500,000 for a person to improve
mobility in their own home.

Obviously none of this isn't without negatives, there are people stealing
content, low effort creators that bring no value and just take up space, people
spreading misinformation or being confidently incorrect, effects on mental
health, but all platforms have those problems.

## China Is An APT

The ban and politics around it are a lot more nuanced than the current political
environment in the United States can reliably discuss.  China, who does have an
interest and some theoretical control over Bytedance and TikTok, is an Advanced
Persistent Threat.  They've demonstrated numerous times that they have little
issue inserting themselves into US networks for various reasons, including a
recent incident where Salt Typhoon, a group operated by the Chinese government,
had a startling amount of infiltration multiple US telco networks[^1].

It's worth remembering that in the course of this discussion, but also a lot of
points are either theoretical or classified.  While classified doesn't mean it's
untrue or false, it does require an implicit trust that a lot of folks have
lost.  Especially when none of the information (not even a little) is shared
even when trying to defend things in court, it's asking an for a lot.

## The Ban Isn't About The Data

The first point I'll make is that this ban isn't about the data of American's
needing protected.  I'm 100% certain data is being collected by TikTok, but data
is being collected in much the same way by US based social media companies.

On the surface, you might argue that things are different because the data isn't
collected by a foreign nation, but that doesn't mean the data isn't over there.
Data collected is available from data brokers, and the US government was caught
purchasing this data already[^2].  I think it's foolish to think that others
haven't caught on to the fact that this data is easily available.  And there are
arguments that this data can even be de-anonymized[^3].

If the concern was really about data, the law would be made in such a way that
the _data_ from _any source_ must be protected.  Laws like GDPR already exist
and are intended to traverse borders to protect citizens of the EU.  A similar
framework could be applied to US citizens data, but obviously this would have
further reaching implications for domestic companies that seem to have a lot to
gain by the ban.

On the note of security, quite a few US politicians are on the platform already.
While most seemed to come and go just for the 2024 election, some used the
platform as a fireside chat of sorts to communicate with the electorate.  A lot
of places, including the US, ban the app on government devices[^4], and this is
a fair restriction.

The argument of data harvesting, though, doesn't go away.  The phones that are
used for these are placed in the vicinity of these figures, collecting the same
data that is alleged to be harvested on citizens.  One would expect that if
things were such a danger, posting on the application wouldn't be allowed at
all.

## The Ban Isn't About Security

Another argument I've heard often is that the app itself is a potential entry
point for a future attack.  It could flipped into a active piece of malware
that's installed on millions of devices.

Mobile operating systems, though, are quite good at isolating malicious apps.
Not only do phones that aren't rooted see the benefits of the walled garden app
stores, where things can be removed or reviewed, but permissions on apps are
quite granular.

Sure, things could go haywire, but that's not a risk exclusive to TikTok. Supply
chain attacks like Solar Winds demonstrate that even if an application is from a
trusted source, there's potential for malicious code to make it into apps.
Thousands of applications have been affected by such attacks[^5].  If we're
worried about apps going rouge on phones, there's significant vectors of attack
outside of a single, highly scrutinized application.

## The Ban Isn't About Influence

The fear that China will use the app to spread propaganda is also a common fear.
While possible, foreign influence has been demonstrated in US owned platforms
too[^6].  The Internet Research Agency in particular has ties to anti-Ukraine
posts recently and posts attempting to influence the results of the 2016
presidential election on domestic social media platforms.

Even just recently, domestic platforms have pledged to remove fact checkers[^7].
This policy change no-doubt in part to win favor with the incoming
administration, which itself has vocally complained about the seemingly biased
fact-checking they're subject to.

If the goal is to create a platform where accurate civil discourse is had, these
changes make X and Meta no better or worse in that regard than TikTok.  These
falsehoods don't need to come from some backroom lever-pull that suddenly pushes
more of a certain narrative to users, but removing barriers and allowing the
popularity of a post to judge its truth is equally effective.

These sections are more speculation and opinion.

## The Ban Is About Optics

As I started to write this, the ban was hours from taking effect.  On Saturday,
the app went offline with a popup explaining the new law and, oddly, thanking
Trump by name for his help in addressing the matter.  Then hours later, a
similar message came up explaining that thanks to Trump's action, service is
restored.  

While Trump and his executive orders are playing a direct role in TikTok's
ability to continue operating, the wording of both that message and the message
once service was restored seem like pandering.

Let's not forget, though, that Trump originally started the ball rolling that
would lead to this eventual ban[^8].  And while the thought of a sale might be
enough appeasement to change minds, that still hasn't happened.  If the
accusations of the grave, ongoing threat the app poses are to be believed,
kicking the can without a concrete sale in the works seems foolish.

A common theme in US politics is also to create a problem, take some meaningless
action against it, then declare the problem solved is a common pattern.  It
scores a quick win and, if you take the word and action at face value as many
do, paints a portrait of swift action to solve problems and win favor.  The
timing and the messaging in the app pain that this was clearly a stunt.

## The Ban Shows Our Government Can Act

One of the most frustrating aspects of this entire process was the sudden
unification of an otherwise divided government.  The last session of congress
was one of the most ineffective by number of bills passed[^9] in the last 50
years, but this issue seemed to be the beacon that all parties could agree on.

Never mind the gun violence killing kids in schools, the cost of living rising
beyond what most americans can afford, the wars and humanitarian crises
overseas, the number of homeless people and veterans here, the disasters taking
place in California and North Carolina, the government nearly shutting down,
members of congress continuing to trade stocks in companies they govern, members
of congress being unfit to serve due to health issues, members of congress being
accused of sex trafficking minors, the broken health insurance system, working
graduates unable to pay off student loans, the rise and normalization of hate
speech ...

A lot of folks argue that this means the evidence of TikTok's national security
risk is _so great_, that this compelled congress to act, but I disagree.  If the
evidence is indeed so great it'd do wonders to release even a small piece.  If
China is really doing what we accuse them of, they know that.  We're already
spilling the beans that we're onto them by taking action, even if we don't admit
to it publicly.  Perhaps it's me being naive, but even a nugget of information
of the alleged threat would go a lot further than "trust us."

On other issues, issues that are quite literally killing Americans daily, we
can't even get a handful of folks crossing the aisle.  Even if it's wasted
breath, members of congress before have shown no problem passing bills that
won't pass the other chamber or will certainly get a veto to make a point.

# The Ban Is About Control

I haven't been back on TikTok since the "ban," but seeing reports of other
social media platforms, namely Meta owned platforms, get very weird about
certain topics also shows one of the true reasons for the hollow threats.
Instagram began censoring content related to Democrats, such as blocking
searches[^10].  Couple this with the changes to their fact checking policies, and
the alignment with the incoming administration seems much more than
coincidental.

Creating the threat of a looming ban, then stepping in to save a platform at the
11th hour gives the President an awful lot of favor with a company.  While he
may not use this favor to adjust the platform to fit what he sees as ideal, the
appearance of such favor might be enough to sway the decision making at TikTok.
Add in partial or even majority US ownership, and the influence becomes even
greater.

Ironically, one of the hallmarks of the 2020 executive order, the Senate
hearings about TikTok, and the current law is the fear that China will use it's
influence over the app promote or block certain content.  Given the blatant
changes at Meta  and the lack of response from the White House, though, it's
been made exceedingly clear that influence is actually fine, it just needs to be
the _right_ influence.  Harvesting data is fine, it just needs to be a _good_
multi-national corporation ran by a US billionaire.
