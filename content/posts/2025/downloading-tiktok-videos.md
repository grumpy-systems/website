With the maybe looming ban of TikTok in the US, here's how to download all your
likes, favorites, and even entire creators you follow.

1) Add [this
   extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/myfavett-download-all-tik/gmajiifkcmjkehmngbopoobeplhoegad?hl=en)
   to Chrome.
2) Go to TikTok and sign in.  You should now have a sidebar with three options:
   Download likes, Download Favorites, Download Accounts
3) Click on one, then chose a folder.  This folder can be used for any of the
   downloads and can also be re-used if you've run the tool before.
4) If you're downloading accounts, you'll then pick which accounts to download.
   You can use the options to select how many to do in a batch and how far down
   to scroll.

You can then either load the `Archive.html` file in a browser locally, or upload
the whole thing to a web server and have a little copy on your network.

Some notes:

* Use local storage.   I tried using SSHFS to go directly to a web server
  locally and the tool crashed often.
* You have to leave the tab open with the sidebar open.
* If you stop or it gets interrupted, just go through the same steps and select
  the same directory.  It will remember preferences (such as which accounts
  you'd like to download) and progress.
* Things don't go fast, but the space requirements aren't crazy.

I'll have thoughts on the ban itself in an upcoming post.
