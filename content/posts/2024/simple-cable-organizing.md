If you're like me you have a problem with keeping nearly every cable you come
across.  From patch cables that ship with new devices, to old phone chargers
that still work and have a micro USB slot, to your stash of new USB-C cables,
you've accumulated several boxes worth.

Once your collection passes a dozen or so cables, you'll inevitably run into a
few issues: namely that the cables will always be a tangled mess and finding
what you need will be nearly impossible.

I found this solution on Pinterest some years ago and adapted it to my own
needs, and for the last several years it's been a wonderful and easy to use
system.  I'd love to give credit where credit is due, but I've lost that post to
time.

Here's my completed system:

## The System

My system revolves around two components that interact: boxes and resealable
plastic bags that fit in that box on end.  For example, if you're box is 6" wide
by 10" tall, your bags should be around that size.  The width is more important
than the height, but if you'd like to put lids on the boxes make sure that they
fit in that dimension too.

We then put each cable in a bag, then stack the bags on end in the box like a
vertical file.  The cords will generally keep the bags propped upright, and the
bags keep things from tangling or otherwise mixing together.

When you need a cable, it acts like a file cabinet.  You can thumb through the
bags to find the one you want, and pull it out and use it.  I organize my boxes
by type, but feel free to do whatever makes the most sense for your application.

I've found some tips to be helpful as well:

* Write anything odd about the cable (like it's wired for a specific
  application) so future you remembers.
* Don't store cables that aren't ready to use.  For example, I make it a point
  to replace any broken RJ45 connectors before storing things so I don't run
  into that later.
* It's OK to store multiple small cables together.  I have a number of smaller
  HDMI adapters, extensions, etc that I put in one bag.  These might tangle, but
  if there's only 5 short cables untangling is an easy task.
* Store cables and adapters that are often used together in one bag.  My console
  cables and USB to Serial adapters are all together since I usually need both.
* Don't mix USB-C, Micro USB, and other flavors.  I mean you _can_, but I feel
  keeping them separate makes digging a lot easier.
* Don't worry about making cables pretty in the bags.  Some cables coil and sit
  in the bag as if it came from the factory, but others have a stiff jacket that
  has been molded into some spiderweb type shape.  Sucking the air out of the
  bag and sealing it will make most cables pretty flat, at least flat enough for
  storage.
* The bags are re-usable!


## My Praises

I've used this system for a number of years and it's proven itself useful a ton
of times.  The biggest is that finding cables is easy as you can thumb through
things like a file cabinet and nothing is ever tangled.  Before, finding a cable
was dumping the box on the ground and untangling cables to find they had one
wrong end or were otherwise unusable.

Besides those, this is also quite space efficient.  The three boxes I have
expand to a medium sized pile when dumped out, and several medium sized piles if
left outside the bags.  When cleaning up things after a recent move, I was
surprised after seeing how large of a moving box of loose cables this replaced.

This has also let me make much more efficient use of my cables as well.  I'm not
buying replacements for things I have, and I'm making use of extra gear that
otherwise would be thrown out or wasting space.  One things I've learned is if
you have a collection of anything (movies, games, wires, nuts and bolts), it's
useless unless you have it organized in some logical way that lets you make use
of it.
