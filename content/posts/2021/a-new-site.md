I'm not a huge fan of meta posts, but this seemed like a fairly major change so
I'm making one.

I've updated my site to use Hugo rather than Wordpress.  Wordpress is nice and
all, but it's fairly complex for this site and with horror stories of rouge
plugins, I didn't feel it was the best choice.

Also, the new static site is a lot faster and a lot easier to work with, so
those are also added bonuses.

Hopefully I'll post more content.  There's a reason I was gone for so long, I'll
detail that in the future.
