# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Grumpy, and I make content about Linux, Servers, and HomeLabs and build
things I think are neat.  I use this site to share all those things.

You can find me on various social media platforms linked below.  I also share
written content and projects on this site. (I'm also joining more platforms, so
don't panic)

{{< social-tag icon="icon-github" link="https://github.com/grumpy-systems" name="GitHub" >}}

(I'm working to migrate data to my new GitHub account, so some things may be broken for now)
