# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Grumpy, and I make content about Linux, Servers, and HomeLabs and build
things I think are neat.  I use this site to share all those things.

You can find me on various social media platforms linked below.  I also share
written content and projects on this site. (I'm also joining more platforms, so
don't panic)
