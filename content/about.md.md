# About

I make content about Linux, Homelabs, software development and more.  I use this
site as the official repository for content I post.

## The Name

My name is obviously not Grumpy, but I opted to use this alias for this content.
I originally posted things under my real name, but after some things grew in
popularity I didn't particularly want people knowing my name or other details.

I'm sure at some point my anonymity will be broken, but for now it's a fun
experiment to try and maintain privacy in environments that usually don't give
much privacy.

## My Content

I create content that's intended to be platform neutral.  I understand that
these platforms aren't the most stable of things, and archiving things I do on a
neutral format seems like the best way to ensure I can platform hop as needed.

All code is released under some open source license.  It should be distributed
with the project.  Videos, text on this site, etc is released under [Creative

If you're interested in commercial distribution of my non-source code material,

## Contacting Me

The best way is to use one of the social media links on my homepage.
