I make use of Google Analytics to track usage on this site.  This service has
certain privacy implications, so I'm drawing your attention to them on the site.

If you block this using Privacy Badger, PiHole, or similar I don't blame you at
all.  I do disable most of the storage permissions, as if you've already hit the
opt out button, to minimize the privacy implications.

But I'm also pretty sure Google wants a more formal Privacy Policy to comply
with their TOS, so here it is.

## What type of information do I collect?

Data for your device, such as the browser you use, operating system, and screen
size are collected.  Other data such as your IP address and approximate location
(State and Country level data) is also collected.  Other data such as the time
you spent on the site and pages you visit here are collected.

## How do I collect information?

Information is collected automatically using data your browser provides to make
the request (such as IP addresses, operating system, etc).  Google Analytics
will store a cookie or two for use on the site to track return visits and your
session.
